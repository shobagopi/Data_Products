# Developing Data Products - Body Mass Index Calculator

It is also known as Quetelet Index. The BMI is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value.

The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong recommends the use of the following BMI ranges

- BMI <18.5       : Low
- BMI [18.5-24.9] : Normal
- BMI [25-29.9]   : Obese Level 1
- BMI [30-34.9]   : Obese Level 2
- BMI [35-39.9]   : Obese Level 3
- BMI >=40        : Obese Level 4
